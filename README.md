# Image-Recognition-Notes
My notes on Image Recognition, with demo code in Python and explanatory Video.

In notes, technique of Image Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network is discussed. I have also described other uses of Image Recognition, applications of Convolutional Neural Network and how the structure similar to the image recognition can also be used in natural language processing with the use of regular expressions.
